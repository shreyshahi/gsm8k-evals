        "response": "To determine the number of pizza slices left over after everyone has eaten, we'll start by calculating the total number of slices available and then subtract the number of slices each person eats.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total number of pizza slices:\n- Each small pizza gives 4 slices.\n- Each large pizza gives 8 slices.\n\nGeorge purchased:\n- 3 small pizzas: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) slices\n- 2 large pizzas: \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) slices\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ slices from small pizzas} + 16 \\text{ slices from large pizzas} = 28 \\text{ slices in total} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many slices each person eats:\n1.
